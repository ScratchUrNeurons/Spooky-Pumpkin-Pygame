# Spooky-Pumpkin-Pygame
The game is a side-scroller where the player controls a pumpkin, attempting to jump between the spooky looking knifes without hitting them. This game is written using Pygame library in Python. Spooky Pumpkin on wider perspective resembles the addictive and very much popular game of early 2014, namely Flappy Bird.
